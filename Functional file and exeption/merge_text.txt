One day, a hare was showing off how fast he could run. He laughed at the turtle for being so slow. After seeing the overconfidence, the turtle moved him to a race. The hare (rabbit) laughed at the turtle's test, and he accepted his demand.
As the race began, the rabbit ran extremely quickly and went far ahead of the turtle and got drained. He thought there was a lot of time to relax as the turtle was far away. Soon he slept, thinking he would win the race easily.
However, the turtle(tortoise) kept walking slowly until he arrived at the finish line. The rabbit sees the turtle on the opposite side of the finish line. The turtle had won the race.
After a shipwreck, a man who was the last standing figured out how to arrive at the shore. He asked God for help. After waiting too long for God to answer his requests, he built himself a hut for his protection with destroyed bits of a shipwreck.
Every day he invested a lot of energy searching for food and looking at the skyline for God's help. One day, when he returned from his food search, he found his little hut burnt to ashes. Losing all hope, he felt helpless and shouted out of anger, "Why God? Why do you never answer my prayers?"
After a couple of hours, a boat arrived at the shore for his rescue. The man asked the captain of the ship, "How could you track me down?" The Captain of the ship answered, "We saw your smoke signal for help."
The man's faith in God's will was re-established.
