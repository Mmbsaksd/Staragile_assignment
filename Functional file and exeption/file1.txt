One day, a hare was showing off how fast he could run. He laughed at the turtle for being so slow. After seeing the overconfidence, the turtle moved him to a race. The hare (rabbit) laughed at the turtle's test, and he accepted his demand.
As the race began, the rabbit ran extremely quickly and went far ahead of the turtle and got drained. He thought there was a lot of time to relax as the turtle was far away. Soon he slept, thinking he would win the race easily.
However, the turtle(tortoise) kept walking slowly until he arrived at the finish line. The rabbit sees the turtle on the opposite side of the finish line. The turtle had won the race.
